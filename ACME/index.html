                We know that during COVID-19, a lot of folks <br> around the city and state are feeling uneasy about <br>
                 the future 
                - we’re not sure what the future holds <br> either. </p>
                <p class="d3"> That said: we know that we love making sure you<br>
                     have the gear you need for your adventures, and <br> 
                     we’re going to keep doing that - with our team <br> 
                     - until the city tells us we can’t.</p>

                     <p class="d4"> But as long as folks like yourself support small <br>
                        businesses around the city, then we’ll be here <br>
                         — every day, making sure your orders arrive on time.
